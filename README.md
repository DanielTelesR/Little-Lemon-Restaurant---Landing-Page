<h1>Little-Lemon-Restaurant - Home Page</h1>
<p>As the final graded assessment in the "HTML and CSS in Depth" course provided by Meta, I had the opportunity to showcase my skills by creating a captivating homepage for a fictional client. For this project, I chose the enchanting restaurant: Little Lemon, based in Chicago, Illinois. 🍋🍽️</p>
<p> Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant that beautifully blends traditional recipes with a modern twist. Inspired by Italian, Greek, and Turkish cuisines, the menu offers a delightful selection of 12–15 seasonal dishes.</p>
<p>Throughout this journey, I had the opportunity to apply the concepts of semantic HTML tags, effectively structuring the provided information. Additionally, I utilized CSS techniques to create a unique user experience, employing grids and flexbox to optimize the layout. CSS selectors and animations allowed me to add interactivity and captivating effects to the webpage. 🌐💻</p>
